  Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!
      A twist on the classic game of rock, paper, scissors.
      You'll be playing against the computer.
      The first to reach three wins takes the title of <<GRAND WINNER>>!

  => Here are the rules:
      Scissors > Paper; Paper > Rock;
      Rock > Lizard; Lizard > Spock;
      Spock > Scissors; Scissors > Lizard;
      Lizard > Paper; Paper > Spock;
      Spock > Rock; Rock > Scissors

  => Example: You play Spock, the computer plays rock. You win because Spock vaporizes rock!

  => Easy peasy. Okay, let's PLAY!
