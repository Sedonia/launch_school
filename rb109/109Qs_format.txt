When working through example problems, answer the following for each:

1. What does the code output? What are the return values?

2. Answer the why behind the output/return:
  - Focus only on the lines of code that deliver the output and return values.

3. Summarize what the problem demonstrates and why: This problem demonstrates the concept of local variable scope/etc…
  - This can be at the beginning or end of your answer - personal preference.

4. Using Markdown: use `backticks` (Markdown formatting) to highlight variable names and methods. Don't worry about lines you are referring (ex: On `line 1` we initialize the local variable…)

5. Always aim to answer: What does the following code output and return? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?
